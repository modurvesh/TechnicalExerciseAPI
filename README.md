# Introduction 
This project contains the source code for a Meter Reading API service. Currently you are able to upload meter readings, search for users and search for meter readings. The project uses a SQL lite database for storage of the users and meter readings.

# Getting Started
You will need Visual Studio 2019+ with the following tools installed in order to run the project locally:
-	.NET Core 6.0
-	ASP.NET Core 6.0
-	Entity Framework Core 6.0.8

# API references
Here is a list of all API references available for use in the project:

**Route** 
```http

```
**Response**

```

**Parameters**

# Build and Test
The project can be ran directly from Visual Studio using IIS Express. Currently there are tests to check the format of each csv record against the existing validation checks. 
TODO: Add tests that directly test the API.

# Contribute 
The API currently only contains the core components. In future releases, here are a few features we will be looking to implement:
-	Route to POST users and store them in the database (set accountId, firstName, lastName). 
-	Authentication header using Basic Auth to login to a user account (for routes that contain sensitive data e.g. user details search)
-	Update POST user route to add additional details (e.g. DOB, address)
-	Route to GET a specific meter reading from a date range set
